## Main Selling Points

* **Free and Open source**: Licensed under the
  [MIT license](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/LICENSE)
  with no hidden costs or caveats
* **Easy-to-install**: Choose between
  [node.js](http://nodejs.org),
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
  [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to run on
  Windows/Mac/Linux
* **Self-contained**: Additional dependencies are pre-packaged or will
  be resolved and downloaded automatically
* **Beginner-friendly**: Hacking Instructor tutorial scripts guide users
  through several of the easier challenges while explaining the
  underlying vulnerabilities
* **Gamification**: The application notifies you on solved challenges
  and keeps track of successfully exploited vulnerabilities on a Score
  Board

  repopulated from scratch on every server startup
* **Re-branding**: Fully customizable in business context and look &
  feel to your own corporate or customer requirements
* **CTF-support**: Challenge notifications optionally contain a flag
  code for your own
  [Capture-The-Flag events](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf)
* **Interoperability**: Integrate with your own training systems via
  WebHook, monitor the extensive metrics or consume challenge
  information directly via API or file import
